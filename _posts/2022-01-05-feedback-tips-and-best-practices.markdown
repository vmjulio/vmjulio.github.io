The Performance Review process is the moment where everyone have the opportunity to go over their achievements from the last 6 months, recognize their peers, give and receive candid and robust feedback that supports continuous growth and development.

It's a way to support our professional growth, strongly relying on supporting people to help them having a bigger impact at our company.

For every employee: It's the moment to be recognized by the achievements of the cycle, and understand how our work is being perceived by others. Here we look back at what worked well and what could have been better, and look forward to define the expectations and goals we want to accomplish in the coming cycle.

For the managers: It's the moment to understand how others evaluate the work of their team, and what are strengths and weaknesses of their reports/clusters, to make more informed decisions about developing people, hiring, staffing, action plans, definition of goals and setting expectations.

For the chapter: The calibration - between members of the chapter and between members of other chapters - is the moment to redesign the chapter strategy in terms of allocation, hiring, development and engagement, and getting a clearer view of the big picture. This map is very useful for future calibrations and to make sure we're rewarding everybody that deserves to be rewarded.

For the company: Having all collaborators sharpening their skills and collaborating better is a way to ensure low attrition, high engagement, high productivity and making sure we have the best-in-class chapters in our industry, ensuring very high quality of the deliveries.


## Give yourself enough time, and start early
The process isn't something you can knock out in an hour and do well. Make sure to give enough time to write the feedbacks, so you don't need to go through the stress of delivering it so close to the deadline.

## Organize yourself for a though week
Make room in your calendar, and be picky about what meetings to attend - remember that everybody will be going through the same process than you.

## Account for the whole cycle, avoid recency bias
The Performance Cycle account for the whole accounted period, so watch out for the recency bias, and give the proper weights to every action.

## Feedback is a gift
Always keep in mind that feedback is a gift! We might receive some though feedbacks regarding our work, but remember that receiving a negative feedback is better than receiving no feedback at all. 

## Be empathetic
We are all humans with emotions, so be empathetic with the other part when you give or receive feedback, but always being candid.

## Beware of our human limitations
Our ego may distort information to protect us from negative emotions, like assuming that certain information is wrong, for example. No matter how self-aware we are, there'll always be something that escapes our comprehension.
